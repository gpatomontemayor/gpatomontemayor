Hi!:wave:

I am Gonzalo Pato Montemayor, a fourth year student of the bachelorâ€™s degree on Applied Mathematics and Computing by the Universidad Carlos III de Madrid.

In my github you will find projects I have carried out during my bachelor's degree and also projects to perform the analaysis and visualizations of my articles at [SAGB](https://sportsanalytics.berkeley.edu/data-journalism.html), where I write data-driven articles about sports :soccer::basketball:.
